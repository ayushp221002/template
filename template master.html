								<h2 class="major">Interest In IT</h2>
								<p>My interest is all about data, databases and database management system. The seed of interest in this kind of things was implanted in my early childhood.<br>As my father is from technical background, in my childhood itself my father used to tell me interesting things related to tech such as mobile phones, web browsing and much more. All these things fascinated me and gradually I started taking interest in all that. There was an exponential growth of my interest in information technology when I was 11 years old and attended a workshop related to how tech giants work, how they earn profit, how they collect our data such as personal information, banking details and much more . In higher classes too I opted for computer science as an optional subject to know more and more about different software. Furthermore, in lockdown amid covid pandemic, I applied for a course which taught basics of programming in python.<br>After completion of my higher secondary education, I decided to study outside my home country and continue my further education in Australia. So, I started looking for universities in Australia and during my research I came to know about RMIT. RMIT have lots of positive reviews on the internet and it is one the most globally reputed university. Also, RMIT has numerous student centric facilities which also attracted me apart from supremely skilled professors who are always ready to help students.<br>
									<br>During my studies, I expect to learn a complete computer language that is python which would help me in my professional career. Also, with my enrolled subjects I would expect to learn to create intricate software which would finally enhance end user experience. In addition to that, during my learning, there would be drastic improvement in my communication skills with help of group assignments.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="/RMIT projects/job.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>As per my specific interest in IT, my ideal job would be of a data analyst. It would be a pleasure to work at that level and I am ready to fight tooth and nail to achieve my idealised job position.<br>
									I have found an ideal job advertisement( Through <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/">https://www.seek.com.au/</a>) from an international company called Equifax which is one of the leading global data, analytical company. It has been operating across 24 country for over 60 years.</p>

									<p>My position in this company would be of a data management analyst. My duty will include regular fetching and managing datasets within service-level agreements (SLAs), investigating anomalies and maintain best efficiency and security. Also, I am responsible to look for operational opportunities and develop a system which would automatically outsource the data which would make effective loading, tracking, and monitoring of supplier’s data.<br>The most appealing thing this position would gift me is an international identity and exposure as I am expected work directly with costumers and data suppliers. In addition to that, by working at this level, there would be a regular supply of knowledge and ideas as I meet new people on regular bases and this will take my communication skills to next level by working in teams.<br>Also, the company treat its employees with an exception. They provide health cover, celebrate birthdays, gives occasional rests, and ensure proper wellbeing. Furthermore, they boast about being able to work with a massive tech giant which is google which has freaked me a lot.</p>

In addition to that, they demand good analytical skills in database management and data visualisation via business intelligence tools. They expect fantastic quality of verbal and written communication skills and being able to channel ideas in the right path. Also, they will consider me first if I have a degree in Information Technology which I will be getting after successfully completion of this course.

									</p>
									<p style="font-size: x-large;">Description Of Current Skills:-</p>
									<p>Currently, if we talk about skills, then I do not have any major skills which could help me getting this job other than being a good listener. Since I have recently passed out from higher secondary school, so I do not have any experience related to my field.</p>
									<p style="font-size: x-large;">Plan to obtain the job:-</p>
									<p>Talking about my plan to obtain necessary skills, qualification, and experience; my one and plan is to be loyal and honest to myself and my studies till completion of this course which will enable me to gain knowledge. After completion of this course, I will start looking for a field job that will help me to gain experience which most crucial step in the ladder to reach to achieve the position which I mentioned earlier. During this period, either I will do a short course related to data analytics or I would gather deeper knowledge in this field myself by reading works of people who excelled in this field. Most probably, I would go on with first option.<br>To sum up, I will be always ready to sweat blood during any course of life whether it be during studies or during job.</p>
